# Custom Embed Reference Implementation and Testing Tool

## Overview

This project contains:
  * several reference implementations of Arc Custom Embeds
  * a "blank" custom embed implementation for quick-start
  * a host application for testing without using Ellipsis

## Documentation

For Arc users with PageBuilder Fusion running, we recommend walking through the process of building an embed first.

[Getting Started with Custom Embeds](getting-started.md)

Whether you're using Fusion or not, it may help to look at our starter code or reference implementations.
